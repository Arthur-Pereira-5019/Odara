# Odara

**Status**: Delayed [for working and learning more important stuff.]

Odara is an 2D RPG C++ game inspired by afrobrazilian culture.

By now, it's just an animated texture with a moving system on an empty screen. Altough it has an unfinished animation and animator system, which after finished could be easily reused to really kickstart the game.

Tech: C++ with Raylib Framework.
